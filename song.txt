Frustrated, degraded
Down before you're done
Rejection, depression
Can't get what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me how I make my way
You ask me everywhere and why
You hang on every word I say
But the truth sounds like a lie
Live to win 'til you die
'Til the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all
Just keep fighting 'til you fall

[Verse 2]
Obsessive, compulsive
Suffocate your mind
Confusion, delusions
Kill your dreams in time

[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me how I took the pain
Crawled up from my lowest low
Step by step and day by day
'Til there's one last breath to go

[Chorus]
Live to win 'til you die
'Til the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all
Just keep fighting 'til you fall
Day by day, kickin' all the way
I'm not caving in
Let another round begin, live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win

[Chorus]
Live to win 'til you die
'Til the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all
Just keep fighting 'til you fall
Day by day, kickin' all the way
I'm not caving in
Let another round begin, live to win
Live to win
Live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win
